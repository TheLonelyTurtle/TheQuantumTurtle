Sonic Pi is a coding platform that makes music.

**About Sonic Pi**

Sonic Pi is a code-based music creation software based off of Ruby.

Sonic Pi was developed by Sam Aaron to support computing and music classes in school.

With a balance between simplicity and complexity, Sonic Pi is easy to learn, and yet so powerful.

The rythm that you can make, to the melody in the code.

Sonic Pi has given musicians a new way to make music, through code.
